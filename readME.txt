Run this program with the following command:
	python3 toCNF.py input.txt
	
The program will output 2 text files. I have attached two under a different name that were generated on my machine
The output file to be used in the davis putnam program made earlier is missing a few key elements.
The specifics missing were not included here and professor Haroon said to not include them so I omitted them.
